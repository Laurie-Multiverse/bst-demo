# Binary Search Tree Demo

## Files
* `BST.js` - class implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST)
* `demo-bst.js` - create a BST and traverse it
* `time-bst.js` - runs comparison between Array and BST for various values of N

## Use this demo
* fork and clone
* `node demo-bst.js`
* Update and explore. Try writing the other traversals or a pretty-print of the BST

## Time the BST
* change the value of N within the `time-bst.js` to see how the search times compare with growth
* `node time-bst.js`
